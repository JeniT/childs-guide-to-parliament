# Child's Guide to Parliament

This is being created for [Accountability Hack 2014](https://www.parliamentweek.org/event/accountability-hack/). The idea is to combine some educational material with real time data to give children a better idea about how Parliament works and to learn about their MP.

## Writing More!

If you want to write more about a person (like if they did something cool) or an interest (like if it's a bit complicated and you want to explain it) you can! Just find the right file in `_includes/members` or `_includes/interests` and write away!

## Parsing

Want to update member data? That's cool. You need Python.

* `cd parsers`
* `pip install -r requirements`
* `./get-members`

When you're done, commit the changes!
