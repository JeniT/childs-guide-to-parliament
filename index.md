*Parliment is made up of the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It is based at the Palace of Westminster in London.*

##The House of Lords

*Members of the House of Lords are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. Some non-party-political members are recommended by an independent body, the House of Lords Appointments Commission.*

>####Fun Fact!

  >54 of the 793 Lords are on Leave of absence (Taking a holiday from being a Lord). 8 of those have been disqualified because they are Judges, and 5 of them Hereditary (They inherited their seat from one of their parents.)
  Of the Lords still in their seats, 90 of them are Hereditary.

##The House of Commons

*The members of the House of Commons are elected by the people. There is an election every 5 years. The next election is  on the 7th of May, 2015. You have to be over the age of 18 to vote. People who are in prison cannot vote.*

>####Fun Fact!

  >650 MPs were elected in 2010.
  >Of those, 507 were men and 143 were women.
  >That's only 22% of the Mps, but the highest proportion of Women ever elected as MPs!
