##Welcome!

There's lots of fun things here about the United Kingdom Parliament. You will find cool facts and figures, videos and tonnes of information about what Parliament does. To help you, we've made a glossary explaining some of the weird words people in Parliament use. There's also a quiz to test your knowledge. Best of all you, **find out which MPs are most interested in kittens!** (actually you can search any area of interest, we just care about kittens!).

##What does Parliament do?

Parliament is made up of the [House of Lords](lords.html) and the [House of Commons](commons.html). It is based at the Palace of Westminster in London.

Laws start of as Green papers, change to White papers, and, after discussion, from Bills to Laws.
