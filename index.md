##Welcome!

There's lots of fun things here about the United Kingdom Parliament. You will find cool facts and figures, videos and tonnes of information about what Parliament does. 

To help you, we've made a [glossary](glossary.html) explaining some of the weird words people in Parliament use. There's also a quiz to test your knowledge. Best of all you can **find out which MPs are most interested in kittens!** (actually you can find out about lots of areas of [interest](http://jenit.github.io/childs-guide-to-parliament/interests/), we just care about kittens!).

##What does Parliament do?

Parliament makes new laws. Some new laws start out as suggestions, in documents called Green papers and White papers. After a lot of discussion, the suggestions become proposals for new laws, called Bills. When a Bill is agreed by Parliament, it becomes an Act.

Parliament is made up of the [House of Lords](lords.html) and the [House of Commons](commons.html). It is based at the Palace of Westminster in London.
