##Welcome!

There's lots of fun things here about the United Kingdom Parliament. You will find lots of cool facts and figures, videos and information about what Parliament does. There is help, with a glossary explaining some of the weird words, and a quiz to test your knowledge. There is also a tool, where you can find out which MPs are most interested in kittens! (actually you can search any area of interest, we just care about kittens!).

##What does Parliament do?

Parliament is made up of the [House of Lords](lords.html) and the [House of Commons](commons.html). It is based at the Palace of Westminster in London.
